# Two pass assembler using C

## What is an Assembler?
Assembler is a program for converting instructions that are written in low-level assembly code into relocatable machine code and generating information along, for the loader.

## What is a Single Pass Assembler?

It is an assembler that generates the object code directly in memory for immediate execution. It passes through your source code only once and then itâ€™s done. It generates instructions by evaluating the mnemonics in operation field and finds the value of symbol and literals to produce machine code.

## What is a Two-Pass assembler?

When an assembler divides its tasks in two passes, it is called a Two-pass assembler.
-	Pass-1:

1.	Defines symbols and literals and remembers them in symbolic table form and literal table form respectively.
2.	Keep track of location counter.
3.	Process pseudo-operations.
-	Pass-2:

1.	Generate object code by converting symbolic op-code into corresponding numeric op-code.
2.	Generate data for literals and look for values of symbols.

## Why do we need a Two-pass assembler?

One-pass assembler cannot resolve issues of forward references of data symbols. It requires all data symbols to be defined before they are being used. A Two-pass assembler solves this confusion by devoting one pass exclusively to resolve all issues of forward referencing and then generates object code with no chaos in the next pass.
